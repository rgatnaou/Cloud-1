#MANUAL
#Sets the address and port for IP, ... on which the server will accept requests.
# Both address and port, or only address or only port can be specified. An address may also be a hostname
#makes nginx listen on all ipv4 address on the server, on port 443
#The included snippets/fastcgi-php.conf configuration takes care of parsing out /foo/bar as the intended URI that the PHP application uses as a route.
#location { try_files ... } - We use the standard try_files directive in a block that catches all URI's. This looks to see if a file or directory sent in the URI 
#exists within the root directory. If it does not exist, it goes to the index.php file, which we know for sure is in the root directory.
